# UT-Qiskit-Fall-Fest-21-Team-6
1.  In this project, we used Qiskit to implement a small game
to learn about statevectors. This project served to provide an overview of single qubit gates and their effect on a qubit. 
Approaching this task visually allowed for a more tangible grasp of the concept as well as an interactive way to 
learn the ins and outs of single qubit gates through a small demo game. 

2.  To use the game, simply run the cells in order and one of the cells will display a sphere containing a vector.
That is the goal position to reach. The cell displayed next will show you your current vector and its orientation. 
The goal is to type in commands so that your qubit's statevector can match the target's statevector's orientation.
There is also a function given to verify if you arrived at the solution for more intricate or deceiving orientations.

3.  Qiskit was used as the SDK to code this entire project and to visualize the qubits. The state vector data was collected from 
running our circuit on one of Qiskit's simulators under the branch of Qiskit Aer's backends (the statevector simulator). 

4.  From this experience I learned a great deal about the fundamentals of quantum computing and circuitry. At a high level, 
gates and state vectors often get ignored but
